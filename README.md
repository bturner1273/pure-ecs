## inspiration/working template repo: [flappybirb](https://github.com/bturner1273/flappybirb)

## v1 goals:
  - canvas2d rendering context
  - working fully typesafe ecs system with event bus/ability to consume promises
  - basic game loop with delta time
  - basic input handling (keyboard/mouse)
  - basic asset loading (images/sounds)
  - basic scene management (switching between scenes, pausing, resuming)
  - basic physics (aabb collision detection, simple gravity, simple velocity/acceleration)
  - basic audio management (play/pause/stop sounds, volume control)
  - basic ui system (buttons, text, images)
  - basic debugging tools (fps counter, entity/component inspector)
  - fully documented codebase with examples
  - ## CLI tool to keep a global Component discriminated union in sync with user-defined components
### Uhh... no comment currently, this was uninspiredly written a little while ago
consider renaming to simplecs-ts

sim - simulation
simple
ecs - entity component system

pronounced simplex ts
